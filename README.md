# Horiseon-Project

This is a business website accessibility improvement project I did for a marketing agency called Horiseon. The project manager had two requirements that he wanted me to fullfill for this project: to create a codebase that follows all accessibility standards and to improve search engine optimization for the website.

1. Creating a codebase that follows all accessibility standards
 When I was navigating through the HTML code I one of the first things I noticed was that none of the image tags had alt attributes embeded into them. These attributes are super important for accessibility because if a user has a vision disability and is using a screenreader to navigate through the Horiseon website, their device will be able to recognize the alt text and give a description of the images. I gave each image an alt attribute so I think any user, despite any disabilities they might have, are going to have a much better experience going through the graphical features of the webpage.

Another feature that I fixed in the source code was the semantic structure. I included comments in the HTML and CSS file for anyone that is interested in seeing the specific changes that I made. Most of the changes involved deleting extra container elememts and consolidating some of the CSS selectors. This really helped make the code more ledgible and easier to make changes to.

2. Improving search engine optimization
I was able to improve the search engine optimization in a couple of ways. The first change that I made was to give the website a title name. This is super important because this has a direct effect on where the website will be listed in the browser search results.

I also updated the code so that the website has functioning internal links in the head of the document. If you click on the link it will take you to the section of the document that it has been assigned to. Another benefit is that since these links are internal they will help users navigate to content section of the website much faster. 

3. What was your motivation?
One thing that really motivated me to work on this project was to get some exposure to the kind of code some developers are writing for their projects. This project gave me some really good insight of the ways to avoid writing code. My instructor is constantly reminding us of how important it is to develop good coding habits because it shows a deep sense of understanding of the work we produce. In addition to helping prevent errors, I feel that these habits are good to have because they can utilized in anything we do in our lives that is unrelated to coding.

4. What did you learn?
One thing that I learned as I was working on this project is how benificial it is to to use simple code to build a functioning website. These kinds of applications can serve as great resources to refer back to when we are trying to embed basic functionality in a project that might have more features or uses a more complex element structure.
